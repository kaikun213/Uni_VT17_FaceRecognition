# TODO
-----------------------------------

### Class Diagrams
* Classdiagrams connection to implementation instead of controller class?
* Split class diagram into smaller class diagrams (for each component)
* Include nicely in document

### Architecture
* A small text/diagram for client (simple server which serves the pages)

### Sequence Diagrams
* Sequence Diagram => Alternative flow question outside the box, Add User as actor who initializes (maybe instead of Application) , flow needs to go back from where the question went to (e.g. "Operation done" should be "Return PN" from User instead of Database)
* Include nicely in document

### General
* Encryption/HTTPS Section add (How to, Description of security, Implementation challenges (We cant get a certificate..) and limits..)
* Terminology needs to fit in the whole document and be consistent (with tought stuff in lecture!)
* 1.2 Priorities:  
Reliability - System should respond in 5sec when user requests (Requirement), write more specific and how can we tackle this? (theoretically)
Portability - Where in the requirements? Usability too.

### Major Design issues
* Reorder section (languages and frameworks may not be included
* Make sure to reference

## **=> STRONG: All sections MUST reference requirements!!**
