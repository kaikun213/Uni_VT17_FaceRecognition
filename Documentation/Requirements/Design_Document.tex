Languages:
Java - great flexibility \& portability
	 - high productivity because of existing frameworks \& previous knowledge 

Spring - great portability/support in the cloud 
	   - easy and fast to bootstrap application with embedded application server
	   - Component based systems (Beans etc.)
	   - fast and uncomplicated support of REST-API features
	   
ORM = SpringData 
	- supports most DB-Technologies and reduces boiler plate code

Cloud platform/Server = Heroku
	- Ease of cloud deployment and continuous development 
	- Free Account for development directly integrated with code sharing platforms like GitHub. Supports Continuous integration!
	
External Face Recognition API 
	- SkyBioMetric(Free), LambdaLabs(Best support, but costly), OpenFace(OpenSource, more work) 
	


Priorities
	- Security - Encryption and Authentication , sensible data
	- Portability/Integration \& Usability - clear defined API
	- Reliability
	

Design Issues:

Used architectural patterns:
Layered Approach 
	- Access Layer (Client/UI/API), Database layer (ORM), Data .. 
Client/Server architecture
	- Separate development, Server provides API (cohesive service)
	- ~> Service oriented architecture (External Service, ASM, USM) supports continuous development, integration and is very scalable. JSON Communication as standard
MVC 
	- Flexibility, Testability increased, separate components as Client/Server and separate logic and data etc.
	
	



1) Authentication - expires when? Usability vs. Security
2) Data storage   - who stores data? PNs/Images Security vs. Performance/Cost
3) All in one component? - Extendability/Security vs. Developing Cost,Cost of component interaction(messaging...)
4)
