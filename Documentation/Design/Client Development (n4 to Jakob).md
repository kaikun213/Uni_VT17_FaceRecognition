# Client Development

- Language and frameworks
- Cross Platform (iOS, Android, WEB) framework? Javascript Framework?
- Which ones do we use and WHY + maybe mention alternatives

### the text:


The client application has to be working on iOS, Android, Microsoft phone and WEB, there is a ton of Cross Platform Mobile development tools out there.
###### For example
- **Xamarin** - which is the most popular choice, a free trail is available and it use the language C#. This will make it more structured as C# is an *OO* language.
- **Phone Gap** - which is the most well known tool, it is open source meaning that it is free. It uses the common web languages to create hybrid apps i.e. HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
- **appcelerator** - lets developers use JavaScript to build their apps, provide mobile testing, it has a GUI to create design (which uses common HTML and CSS), and lastly it is free.

There is plenty more but there is one last option that we want to consider which is to create it only to WEB, the question we need to ask ourselves is: *are we going to produce a app for the different app stores or do we only want it to work on the different devices (Android, iOS, Microsoft phone)?* We will not create an app for the different app stores out there since that is not in the requirements, because of this the application will be built using common WEB languages. We will use responsive design to style our app so it will be desktop, tablet and mobile friendly. For this we will use a CSS framework, all CSS frameworks comes also with a JavaScript framework for design purpose (animation etc.).

###### CSS frameworks
- **Bootstrap** - the most common framework out there, easy to use and creates fast design. Great for dynamic designing thanks to its grid system. The major drawback is that it will look boring and old.
- **Material Framework** - Google's own framework, a google look alike framework.
- **Semantic UI** - a fresh framework that has grown quite popular in the last couple of years. It uses the JavaScript jQuery framework which is easy to use and has great AJAX calls which can be helpful.   

This is only a design option and we will go with the Semantic UI because it has a suiting design, and for the use of jQuery.
